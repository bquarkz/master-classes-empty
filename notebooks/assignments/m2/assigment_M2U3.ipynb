    "## BACKGROUND:\n",
    "This is Data for a Study of Risk Factors Associated with Low Infant Birth Weight. Data were collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, during 1986.\n",
    "Description of variables:\n",
    "* **LOW*** – Low Birth Weight (0 means Not low and 1 means low)\n",
    "* **AGE** - Age of the Mother in Years\n",
    "* **LWT** - Weight in Pounds at the Last Menstrual Period\n",
    "* **RACE** - Race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Other)\n",
    "* **SMOKE** - Smoking Status During Pregnancy (1 = Yes, 0 = No)\n",
    "* **PTL** - History of Premature Labor (0 = None, 1 = One, etc.)\n",
    "* **HT** - History of Hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No)\n",
    "* **UI** - Presence of Uterine Irritability (1 = Yes, 0 = No)\n",
    "* **FTV** - Number of Physician Visits During the First Trimester (0 = None, 1 = One, 2 = Two, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    " Consider *LOW* as dependent variable and remaining variables listed above as independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUESTIONS\n",
    "1. Import BIRTH WEIGHT data.\n",
    "2. Cross tabulate dependent variable with each independent variable.\n",
    "3. Develop a model to predict if birth weight is low or not using the given variables.\n",
    "4. Generate three classification tables with cut-off values 0.4, 0.3 and 0.55.\n",
    "5. Calculate sensitivity and specificity and misclassification rate for all three tables above. What is the recommended cut-off value?\n",
    "6. Obtain ROC curve and report area under curve."
