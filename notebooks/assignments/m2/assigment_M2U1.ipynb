    "## QUESTIONS:\n",
    "1. Obtain Box-Whisker Plot of Employee Engagement Score by Gender and interpret\n",
    "2. Obtain Box-Whisker Plot of Employee Engagement Score by Department and interpret\n",
    "3. Summarize Employee Engagement Score by Combinations of Gender and Department using n, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation.\n",
    "4. Can you infer that the average EES is the same for all departments?\n",
    "5. Summarize “Feedback” by Gender using count and percentage.\n",
    "6. Summarize EES for each level of feedback using n and mean."
