    "\n",
    "> Let me go for a more complete explanation. Into the population of 1000 runners we have 200 the age of the 10s, 500 the age of the 20s and the remain of 300 the age of the 30s. If you SRS (20 units) the whole population without stratification, you could get something like: 12 the age of the 10s, 0 the age of the 20s and 8 the age of the 30s; It is not a good sample since there are no units from the 20s. It is SRS that is ok, but it will be great to have a better (stable, more representative) sample. That is why stratification came handy, we could divide the population by age: 200, 500 and 300, and keep those proportions when sampling (0.2, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively). So the new sampling (from each stratum) could be something like: the 10s ($ 0.2 * 20 = 4 $), the 20s ($ 0.5 * 20 = 10 $) and the 30s ($ 0.3 * 20 = 6 $); what will give us a much more stable sampling."

For Stratified Sampling we sample for each stratum. For Clusters, we sample the entire group.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using the same example of runners, the Stratified Sampling example is above (and we could say that is for a single city). We could add the Cluster example saying that our population is the whole country, and it will be impossible to let people go to each city and sample them individually (that is not logistically or economically viable). In that way we use the cities as a cluster, and sample cities (SRS) from the country. And for each city in the sample, we run SRS (20 units) without (one-stage) or with (two-stage) stratification.\n",
